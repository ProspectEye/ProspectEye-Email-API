Example on integration setup
---------------------
A link in the email can look like this: http://www.example.com/showcase.php?pedata=M1237632

The data that your Email Marketing Solution should add to every url in the emails is the parameter pedata=M1237632. pedata=M
is the identifier for your solution where M could be any letter. ProspectEye will reserve a letter for you. The rest is an
id (1237632) that is an unique identifier for the information about the email recipient. The information should be collectable
via a webservice where the url-id is the identifier to fetch the data.

The fetchable data could be represented as a string

``
email=firstname.lastname@example.com|subject=example email|campaign=example campaign
``

or JSON

```
{
  email: 'firstname.lastname@example.com',
  subject: 'example email',
  campaign: 'example campaign'
}
```

The follow procedure is praxis:

- Email is sent from your Email Marketing Solution
- Every link has the added parameter pedata with an identifier
- A recipient clicks on a link in the email and the pedata is sent to ProspectEye
- ProspectEye fetches the data via the Email Marketing Solution webservice with the identifier
- ProspectEye displays the data to enhance the lead
